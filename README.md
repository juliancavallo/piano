This is a simple piano with the chromatic scale, with 24 keys avaliable (two octaves).

All keys are binded to a letter in the pc keyboard. You can click the "Show keyboard letters" button to have a look. If the button is red, it shows you the letters for a 
few seconds. If it is blue, it shows the letters until you click it one more time.

Also, the up and down buttons on the rigth allows you to change the octave you are currently playing.

This was made entirely with HTML, CSS and Javascript, so you can run in locally just cloning the repository and opening the index.html.
