This is a simple piano with the chromatic scale. 

All keys are binded to a letter in the pc keyboard (you can click the Show keyboard letters to have a look). 
Also, the up and down buttons on the rigth allows you to change the octave you are currently playing.

This was made entirely with HTML, CSS and Javascript, so you can run in locally just cloning the repository and opening the index.html.
